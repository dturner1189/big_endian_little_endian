# Big Endian or Little Endian Machine

This is a simple program to determine if the machine you are using is a big or a little endian machine. The program is written in c++.

## What This Is

This is an easy way to tell weather the machine you are currently running is a big or little endian machine; that is, what the byte ordering is.

### Running

Unix users proceed with the following commands in your terminal: 

```
$ make
$ ./Endian
```

Windows users will need to compile themselves. Simply run the executable after compilation.

### Manifest


```
makefile
```
Compilation instructions for users machines. 


```
big_endian_little_endian.cpp
```

Simple c++ code for program.
